## 🧠 About the Notes

These notes are **entirely handwritten by me**, summarizing and organizing Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts in Java for clarity and effective learning. Each page reflects my personal approach to understanding, practicing, and revising DSA topics.

---

## 📘 Repository Structure

- **Daily Uploads:** Organized by day (`Day1`, `Day2`, etc.), 5-10 pages per day.  
- **Format:** High-resolution images (JPEG/PNG) for readability.  
- **Optional Summaries:** Some days include typed notes summarizing key formulas, examples, and important concepts.  

This structure ensures easy navigation, gradual learning, and systematic revision.
