## ðŸ“… Upload Schedule

Notes are uploaded **2 pages daily**, gradually building a complete set of 300 pages covering the entire Java DSA syllabus.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- **Java Fundamentals:** Variables, loops, functions, classes, object-oriented programming.
- **Core DSA:** Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, recursion, dynamic programming, sorting & searching algorithms.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Backtracking, greedy algorithms, bit manipulation, and problem-solving strategies.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- A **self-made reference** for coding interview preparation.
- A **visual learning resource** for learners who prefer handwritten explanations.
- A **revision guide** for academic exams and self-study.
